					This past summer (2013) I spent most of my time working with the awesome people at Rally Software. As an intern, I was led by a mentor and worked with 4 other interns to build a new product for Rally. That product came to be known as <a href="https://waffle.io">waffle.io</a>, a light-weight agile project management tool built with developers in mind.

					Over the last few years, I've spent much of my time studying for and attending courses in the mathematics department. My performance has been recognized by way of the Dean's List. I will graduate this Spring (2014).

					Last Winter/Spring, I decided to leave college for a semester and travel to Chicago for a Ruby on Rails course put on by The Starter League. This is where I learned a great deal of the web development foundation that has carried me into the present.

					This is <a href="https://waffle.io">waffle.io</a>, a light-weight project management tool for teams of developers. We started waffle with the vision of making open source projects run more smoothly, and letting possible contributors figure how to most effectively help. It is built with a mongodb/node.js backend and a backbone.js/chaplin frontend.

					While attending The Starter League, a group of five other students and I formed a team to build a web application. Our vision turned into <a href="http://www.startnagging.com">nag.</a> Nag is a way to keep track of the things you've loaned to friends, as well as a way to remind them to return those things in a timely manner.

				<p class="span8 offset2 after-image">
					We built Nag with Ruby on Rails, Sass, Haml, jQuery. As well, a core component of the appication is its integration with Facebook, meaning we worked pretty closely with the Facebook API. Check out <a href="https://github.com/lateplate/sl-demo-day">nag on Github.</a>
